# Collaboration

Changes to the `master` branch are discouraged. Instead you should work using
feature branches that will be merged into `master` using PR (Pull Requests) and
a review process. At pull request time, reviewers will automatically be picked
according to the [CODEOWNERS](./CODEOWNERS) file (see [here][codeowners] for its
syntax).
